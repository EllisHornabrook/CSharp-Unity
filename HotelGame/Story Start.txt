You are travelling across the country to join your best friend, who is on a remote getaway vacation with their family.
The journey is long and you are already 6 hours in to your drive, with a fair few hours to go. It is getting late, you feel your eyes getting heavier by the minute.
After driving for a little while longer, you see a Hotel at the end of a small badly lit road. You think it's best to rest for the night and take the turning to the hotel.
As you approach you see a sign that reads "Welcome to Hunt Hotel - No reservation needed", the hotel looks relatively nice, you park your car and head in.
You are greeted by a tall, gaunt man who greets you with a wide and inviting smile. You check in and head to your room...

Upon getting in to your room and unpacking your bags, you realise that the bolt on the inside of your door is broken.

What do you do?
1. Go back to reception, highlight the broken bolt and ask for another room.
2. Don't worry about it, you're only there for one night.
